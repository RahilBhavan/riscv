# Experiment log

## Initial implementation — 2026-10-17

The workspace initially contained only a placeholder README and icon. No week-one core or remote was present. A new educational implementation, test oracle and open-source implementation flow were created. The user subsequently confirmed there is no earlier draft. These are baseline measurements of the new implementation.

Question: does the pipeline preserve sequential architectural behavior under the supplied memory contract?

Method: directed instruction/hazard/trap cases plus 20 seeded random programs; compare each retired PC, instruction, destination, value and trap flag, and the complete ordered byte-write stream. Run in Icarus and Verilator. See `reports/verification.json` for counts, `tests/run.py` for inputs/oracle, and `build/regression.log` after reproducing.

Question: can the design map and route on an inexpensive FPGA family using open tools?

Method: registered measurement shell, iCE40 HX8K CT256, 12 MHz target, seed 1. See `reports/implementation.json` and raw routing evidence. Excludes memories and board peripherals. No board was connected or programmed.

Question: what coverage is actually collected?

Method: Verilator core-only line instrumentation, no source exclusions; count nonzero points over total points. Functional bins are a separate fixed 46-bin instruction/outcome plan. Neither metric establishes architectural certification, exhaustive operand coverage or hazard-cross completeness.

Open work: external ISA-model/ACT4 integration; simulation invariants and mid-flight reset tests; broader hazard crosses; exhaustive isolated DOT4 lane sweep; matched RV32I scalar/DOT4 kernel benchmark; DOT4 area/timing ablation; synchronous-memory/board integration. The build guide distributes these across the learning workflow.

## Active build sprint — October 17–18, 2026

The user wants to build and understand the project today and tomorrow. Follow [TWO_DAY_BUILD.md](TWO_DAY_BUILD.md). Priorities: reproduce the reference, add personal directed tests, explain hazards and DOT4, perform one controlled experiment, and rerun coverage and synthesis. There is no draft to recover. Hardware board integration and broader research experiments are follow-up work. User-performed work and measurements should be recorded below as they happen.
